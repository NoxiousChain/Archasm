I'm a computer science student who is currently pursuing my passion for game development. With a solid understanding of programming fundamentals and a keen interest in game 
design, I have embarked on a journey to create my own game. I am dedicated and driven, utilizing my skills and knowledge to bring my vision to life and make a meaningful 
impact in the current project I am working on.
